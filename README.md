# XML2HTML
Use XML/XSD/XLST to generate interactive User Interface. PHP 7.4 (later 8) shall be used as an experimental language. Idea is to check if this approach is feasible for repetative task, where user can provide XML (follow XSD rules) and UI can be generated with all the validations and other interactions prefined as metadata in XML tags.
